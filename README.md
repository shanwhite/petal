# Petal

## Our Project
This is a group project for Mobile Application Development (CS385) with the theme of 'Life Improvement'. 
Petal is a Pet Care Assistant app which keeps track of all pet-related responsibilities, including feeding, grooming, vet appointments, and walks.
Its key features include a schedule for feeding and exercises, reminders for medication, milestone tracking for vaccinations, and pet-related tips.
